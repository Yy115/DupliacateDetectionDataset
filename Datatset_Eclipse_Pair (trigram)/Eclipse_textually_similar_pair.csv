equals/hashCode implementation causing out of handles'],['   the short story is that decorationoverlayicon has a broken equals hashcode implementation when the decorate object is an image descriptor    this version of decorationoverlayicon is only used   within resourceextensionlabelprovider  the problem is that resourceextensionlabelprovider is a workbenchlabelprovider which handles its own lifecycle of images by using a resourcemanager  the resourcemanager uses a map  for which the image descriptor it the key  since the equals hashcode is broken  the map always says the image descriptor is not present   since resourceextensionlabelprovider is used for the project explorer view  depending on how the image descriptors are created by extensions  means that every single refresh of the view causes new images to be created  for some users this means that you can run out of os handles multiple times per day  see bug   for an example of that stemming from cdt     i will attach a gerrit that demonstrates the broken test case for review before trying to work on a fix     note  i have not yet tried to identify if it is also broken for image     i am attempting a workaround in cdt   afaict this has been a problem since   or so  caused by performance fixes in bug   and  bug   '],1

trivial sirius viewpoint defined     to reproduce this trace  open the domain test project in project explorer or model explorer to initialize a sirius session    and the exception was thrown when the editors defined by the other projects were installed   during debugging  i have found two places were such exceptions were thrown by sirius    in danalysissessionimpl when initializing the sessionresourcestracker  the resolution call is called without any transactions  this caused linking errors when initializing the sirius session  see the original exception trace    in sessionresourcessynchronizer  when the model was changed outside a sirius editor    the reload was included in an exclusive  read only transaction  however  in this case very similar exceptions were thrown to the original post   i will also provide a gerrit change shortly with a simple fix of moving this actions inside a write transaction '],1

triggered when we include the javax transaction package via an external library  directly including the sources in the project does not trigger the exception    the exception is triggered  no matter if the library is directly included   or if it is located in the target platform    the exception is not tied to a specific library  we tested several libraries that provide javax transaction and each of them showed the same problem    the exception does not occur when maven itself runs in a jdk   execution environment    i assume that jdk   might trigger the exception aswell  but we did not test that    the exception is not tied to the age   of the used libraries  we tried and compiled one ourself  using   as target source level and included that jar in the test project  the exception still occurred    in our whole project    tm resume  is the only line of code that triggers that exception  removing the call makes the exception go away    importing the project into eclipse photon thats

info '],['NullPointerException with xzCompress in SimpleArtifactRepository.getLocation()'],['we ve been building a project with an old tycho version   and have been trying to upgrade our eclipse environments from mars to neon    this caused serialization incompatibilities for serializable lambdas because code produced by tycho       generates objects that neon   built versions cannot de serialize  therefore  we finally tried to upgrade to tycho       so that things match and are up to date again  this  however  caused the below exception during our product build  when i debugged this i found that simpleartifactrepository calls its superclass constructor with null for the location parameter which seems to be causing the exception later  it would be possible to pass through the location argument to the simpleartifactrepository  thus creating a patch that could make things work  however  i then found out that simply adding  xzcompress false  xzcompress  also seems to solve

iextension getnamespaceidentifier  implementation delivers some data even if no one specifies the namespace   and it delivers by default the bundle id   unfortunately  not all developers read javadocs  and so many replaced the old call to getnamespace  to getnamespaceidentifier  or just used the new api wrongly     therefore there are still places around where the authors wanted to work with bundle id s but used iextension getnamespaceidentifier   as said  it works as long as one does not specify extension point namespace  i believe that from    matches in my platform workspace most uses of the

jgit util fileutils lastmodified  incredibly often  now that s one of the operations that are known to be slower on a windows file system than on typical linux or mac file systems     lastmodified  is called literally hundreds of times even if only the selection changes  and a few hundred more times when a context menu in the package explorer or git repository view is to be opened  we even get these hundreds of calls when the repository the selection belongs to doesn t change   printing out a running count for each call of fileutils lastmodified  quickly gets into the    all by only clicking around a little   this is not good at all   the problem here is that eclipse re evaluates many handler enablements when the selection changes  for some commands we were able to reduce this via the repositorysourceprovider  but evidently there are still many handlers that determine the repository from the selection  and many commands then also try to determine some repository state   in their enablement expression or in isenabled   each of these may access files on disk  and typically checks lastmodified  to figure out whether state cached in repository needs to be re loaded or not   can this be changed  for a single selection change i don t want to test a few hundred times whether the packedrefs file s last modified time   has changed  i want to check that once  and be done with it for all the enablement calculations for this event  one way might be not to override isenabled  in our handlers but setenabled   the object is the evaluation context  repositorysourceprovider could

configuration to a vm that includes threads that come and go relatively frequently  which results in the thread tree view in the debug tab being updated  i only bring this up because the backtrace from the error view says that this is a swt error related to removing items from a tree  however  the thread activity far outpaces the periodic appearance of these panels  so this may be a coincidence   at this point i ve upgraded two machines  and both of them exhibit this behavior when run against the same debug configuration   it s possible that this was happening in      but i don t think so because this panel is pretty annoying and i would have noticed   unfortunately it s difficult to come up with steps to reproduce this  the problem happens if i m just sitting here staring at the ide and otherwise doing nothing  the local development situation is large and complex  so there s nothing i can hand over  the first thing i d try to reproduce this on a smaller scale would be to cook up a test app that causes a bunch of thread activity  set up a remote debug configuration for it  then run  attach  and sit back and see what happens   the backtrace from the event view says   java lang

different implementations  afaik   anyway  the swt error is because the  viewindex  we are trying to remove from the tree is      and the index is passed to getviewer  remove  at line   in org eclipse debug internal ui viewers model treemodelcontentprovider handleremove    so the  viewindex  is    and the  modelindex        the  modelindex  was not     from the delta  so the only way  viewindex  is    can be because treemodelcontentprovider modeltoviewindex  returned    for given  modelindex   and that happens only if filtertransform modeltoviewindex  returns     and this only if filtertransform node modeltoview  returns      so looks like the filteredindexes are not empty   we have two filters installed  showsystemthreadsaction and showrunningthreadsaction  at least one from them must  filtered  some of the delta elements  for example showsystemthreadsaction filters system threads  and this is enabled in our software   so it looks like we get a model delta for a system thread that is filtered out in the view  and for whatever reason this didn t happen with eclipse          i believe a simple fix would be to simply add a guard before calling treeviewer remove  with negative values '],1

org eclipse swt widgets display readanddispatch    note  the test runs with   screen size  so the debug view shows  debug breadcrumb  instead of the  usual  tree  they do have different implementations  afaik   anyway  the swt error is because the  viewindex  we are trying to remove from the tree is      and the index is passed to getviewer  remove  at line   in org eclipse debug internal ui viewers model treemodelcontentprovider handleremove    so the  viewindex  is    and the  modelindex        the  modelindex  was not     from the delta  so the only way  viewindex  is    can be because treemodelcontentprovider modeltoviewindex  returned    for given  modelindex   and that happens only if filtertransform modeltoviewindex  returns     and this only if filtertransform node modeltoview  returns      so looks like the filteredindexes are not empty   we have two filters installed  showsystemthreadsaction and showrunningthreadsaction  at least one from them must  filtered  some of the delta elements  for example showsystemthreadsaction filters system threads  and this is enabled in our software   so it looks like we get a model delta for a system thread that is filtered out in the view  and for whatever reason this didn t happen with eclipse          i believe a simple fix would be to simply add a guard before calling treeviewer remove  with negative

modelindex        the  modelindex  was not     from the delta  so the only way  viewindex  is    can be because treemodelcontentprovider modeltoviewindex  returned    for given  modelindex   and that happens only if filtertransform modeltoviewindex  returns     and this only if filtertransform node modeltoview  returns      so looks like the filteredindexes are not empty   we have two filters installed  showsystemthreadsaction and showrunningthreadsaction  at least one from them must  filtered  some of the delta elements  for example showsystemthreadsaction filters system threads  and this

breadcrumb  instead of the  usual  tree  they do have different implementations  afaik   anyway  the swt error is because the  viewindex  we are trying to remove from the tree is      and the index is passed to getviewer  remove  at line   in org eclipse debug internal ui viewers model treemodelcontentprovider handleremove    so the  viewindex  is    and the  modelindex        the  modelindex  was not     from the delta  so the only way  viewindex  is    can be because treemodelcontentprovider modeltoviewindex  returned    for given  modelindex   and that happens only if filtertransform modeltoviewindex  returns     and this only if filtertransform node modeltoview  returns      so looks like the filteredindexes are not empty   we have two filters installed  showsystemthreadsaction and showrunningthreadsaction  at least one from them must  filtered  some of the delta elements  for example showsystemthreadsaction filters system threads  and this is enabled in our software   so it looks like we get a model delta for a system thread that is filtered out in the view  and for whatever reason this didn t happen with eclipse          i believe a simple fix would be to simply add a

 an error has occurred  see the log file        the error occurs every time i try to start it   i ve even gone through the sequence of reinstalling eclipse and going through the same steps  and the result is the same   this may be caused by some sort of communications error  but i m just guessing  there s something odd going on with the proxy servers used at our company  we recently decommissioned the old proxy  which i ll call  old proxy  here  we re now all using the  new proxy   and all my settings in the vm use the  new proxy   i updated apt with that proxy and installed some external tools   when i ran the eclipse installer  it first failed  prompting me to set the proxy  so i set it to the  new proxy   and it still failed   just in case  i tried setting it to the  old proxy    that worked   it finished installing and i launched it  i opened the marketplace client  i installed some plugins  when i restarted  it got the described error   consistently   there s obviously something odd going on with the proxy   it may be directly related to the error i m getting here  but i don t know that   the relevant log entries are at the end of this
