0,  to integrate the functionality of taking screenshots on android components  it will be ideal to have access to  capturepixels  throught the  geckosession   as we have the  geckosession  completely decoupled from the  geckoview  instance  it s pretty hard for us to integrate it as it is   ,  created attachment   screen shot       at       am png  build    device  iphone xr ios       preconditions    go to settings    display and select  dark theme   steps to reproduce     clean install firefox    open the menu and tap library    go to bookmarks panel    go to downloads panel  actual results     assets are barely visible   expected results    in previous builds the assets had a grey color in dark theme   ,0
1,  created attachment     png  master build    xcuitests covering as are failing     build   tests  it is also possible to reproduce manually on simulator   and ipod touch   these issues     more than   top sites are shown  so the control page button does not appear when it should  please see screenshots attached  it is necessary to add more than   sites so that there are more than   top sites and the view when tapping on control button is broken     long press on a top site to open it in private mode is not working  long pressing on the site opens the context menu  but when tapping on open in new private tab option nothing happens  investigating why the other tests fails  the error is in the assertion when trying to count and compare the sites that there should be  but seems that the problem is that it is not possible to access them   looking at the logs    it seems that app tables  top sites   is not defined   changing these lines   let topsites   app tables  top sites   cells  topsitescell   let numberoftopsites   topsites children  matching  count  with these ones   let topsites   app cells  topsitescell   let numberoftopsites   topsites cells matching  count  make the tests pass locally   not sure if that is the cause  it is strange because going back to a commit where these tests passed in the past  i can reproduce this issue now locally   ,  filed by  cbrindusan

44,  in focus we would like to use the canonical link for the share feature in the future      link element  we would need geckoview to expose this value to us  going forward there will be more  page metadata  that we may be interested in   so i wonder if we should go ahead and create some page metadata api callback that we can iterate on for future requirements   ,  for the pocket stories in activity stream the goal is to always have enough to show exactly   row of pocket stories  on the iphone that would be    on the ipad thats    so when fetching stories from the pocket api  we always fetch       if any of those fail to parse and we end up with fewer stories  when displaying stories on the ipad the app will crash    we assume that either we will get   stories or    but don t handle the case where we fail to parse    in this case we still assume we have   and try to display   stories crashing on the last one   ,0

57,  nick c experienced this issue   could be an opportunity to insert animation and appropriate message when we have slowness in loading content   ,  not sure if this should be treated as an event  deeplink or etc  but essentially would like the ability to tell leanplum to only show a specific in app message   to users who are on a reader mode available web page   stefan mentioned something about limiting this ability to only when a campaign is running to limit the event tracking   ,0
58,   webextensioncontroller java  reads the  extensionid  from the bundle  except for extension messages  in extension messages  the internal  sender extensionid  was unintentionally exposed  but when that was fixed in       sender extensionid  got added again   the logic could be simplified by unconditionally reading  extensionid  off the bundle  as explained at       ,  when  org mozilla gecko geckothread runuithreadcallback  shows up on the main thread in a profile  doesn t call into other functions so it s difficult to answer essential perf questions like   what is it executing     does that need to happen now    and  what caused this method to be running now   it also makes it difficult for the perf team to identify the root cause of perf issues with this code  causing imprecise perf bug reports that require further investigation  for example  see bug   and this recent profile we took of opening the tabs tray      i d suggest adding profiler markers that explain what runuithreadcallback is executing   if there is another way to answer  what is runuithreadcallback  executing from a profile  perhaps this isn t necessary –   let me know how we can do that      ,0

65,  so far there are no xcuitests to cover pocket within firefox ios  it is not accessible when debugging and so we are unable to create tests for it   since in addition to the previous recommended by pocket feature there will be more content it may be interesting to have tests testing this feature   ,  while writing the tests for bug    i noticed have a small race where calling geckosession open  immediately after receiving geckosession contentdelegate oncrash  sometimes tries to reuse the dead process  this only seems to happen on arm emulators and it s much worse with a debug build   ,0

71,  in android components and the reference browser we want to show a bottom panel with the  history  stack of a tab and allow the user to navigate to a specific page in the tab s history   as an example long press on the  back  button in fennec  screenshot    images githubusercontent com               jpeg  this bug is more about a discussion around how a consumer of gv can implement such a feature than a concrete api request   for developing the component we most likely want       a history stack with all urls visited in a session     an index that points to the position in the stack the session is currently in      a way to navigate to a specific index or multiple steps back forward  for   there was some discussion on slack whether gv should provide this list or whether the app is reposible for maintaining this list itself with the help of the historydelegate  a risk here is that the app list and the list gecko has could get out of sync and then navigating the history would not be possible anymore  webview offers copybackforwardlist    for   i couldn t find anything in webview  there s cangobackorforward  but you d have to do some kind of binary search on that to determine the index you are at   for   webview has gobackorforward     ,  in our geckoview based apps we would like to offer a  reader view  like ability    this bug should be the start of a discussion about whether that s a functionality that geckoview should provide or something that is up to the app to provide   geckoview   would have more control over the content and could potentially provide a better reader view implementation than the app code     in any case we would need some kind of api  either some  reader view  api directly  or the neccesary hooks to manipulate the content from the app side     ,0
73,  from github    mobile fenix issues       this might be related to            steps to reproduce   to make it easier to reproduce  just go to https     guru converter encode audio  upload a   mb or more audio file and select  html audio  as output format  then  create a new page in your server and paste the generated code  access the page you ve just created           expected behavior   the audio element should load the audio file without problems           actual behavior   the audio element seems  empty  and does not load the audio file  in my opinion  it seems to be a memory issue  it must be that firefox on android sets a memory limit of some sort  however  loading  big  files using   works just fine in firefox   chrome desktop versions  as well as in all chromium based android browsers         it is also worth mentioning that everything works fine if you use a smaller file  e g  a   mb file  i have not tested it  but i imagine the same thing happens with video elements       in my particular case  i need to load audio using   as i get the audio source from a tts online service           device information        samsung galaxy        firefox        change performed by the  move to bugzilla add on     ,  created attachment     html  this was initially reported in   bugs issues    steps to reproduce        visit   singlelist in firefox nightly   on android and sign in    click on  create a template  button    scroll down to the photos section and click add photos    select a photo taken with a camera from a photo gallery  expected  photo uploaded actual  photo doesn t upload  the upload process remains in loading state  i ve attached a reduced test case  the problem seems to be that in firefox on android  img onload  never gets called  neither does  img onerror  with large data uris  the image i m using is     in size    this is probably related to   bug cgi id    i ve noticed that uploading works for screenshots  but not for the photos  since they re generally greater in size   ,1

79,   contentparent  markasdead   is used by gecko s content process management to remove a defunct  contentparent  object from the list of running content processes   note that the actual content process that is associated with this object might still be running  albeit it should be shutting down  the point is that  as far as gecko is concerned  the process is no a longer viable candidate for running content  from geckoview s standpoint  we should also be removing that process from candidate content processes by unbinding its service      ,  sometimes in automation    the device will lose connectivity and we will get mysterious failures  we should monitor the network status in gve and testrunneractivity and crash immediately if the network is lost   ,0

86,  this functionality is disabled in bug    the longer term fix is to re enable this feature which will require a small amount of ux work     there are   methods that need implemented in the  wkuidelegate  to enable this feature   func webview    determines whether the given element should show a preview   func webview    called when the user performs a peek action   func webview    called when the user performs a pop action on the preview   note  we will also need to remove the  webview allowslinkpreview   false  line from tab swift that was added in bug     ,  in geckoview we have  registerwebextension  and  unregisterwebextension  to run first party extensions in apps   for third party extensions  we need to support installing and uninstalling an extension so that the following things can happen     we check signatures   we remember settings and options for the extension   the extension runs at startup    we want to reuse code from the  addonmanager  as much as possible here  probably using the  webextensioncontroller  for this   this bug will likely turn into a meta bug   ,0

100,  after user changed password on desktop  every rust call done from mobile should get an  fxaunauthorizedexception   so that the user re authenticates  however  after password change  there is usually a    seconds window  in which performing a call to get all devices from android components    ignorecachearg  e     returns the devices even though password is changed  while the call to get all remote tabs    error     returns only local tabs  even in those   seconds    this leads to unwanted states in fenix during that time window   ,  carthage fails because it tries to download alamofire as a binary package  while the last alamofire is compile for swift       adding   no use binaries does not help because them leanplum is skipped  which is only available in binary form   ,0

129,  in our geckoview based apps we would like to offer a  reader view  like ability    this bug should be the start of a discussion about whether that s a functionality that geckoview should provide or something that is up to the app to provide   geckoview   would have more control over the content and could potentially provide a better reader view implementation than the app code     in any case we would need some kind of api  either some  reader view  api directly  or the neccesary hooks to manipulate the content from the app side     ,  tests are failing in the teardown when trying to tap on the menu button to go to settings and then to clear private data  fix is easy  instead of using the label for the menu button  which is the same now as for the library button  let s use the ids that have been added  ,0

137,  keeping a separate section for bookmarks doesn t look very good  if there aren t enough bookmarks to fill a row you re left with blank spaces which make the bottom section of the new tab look odd    instead merge bookmarks back into the highlights section but still keep the query separate  keeping the query separate prevents bookmarks from being cached which will allow new bookmarks to show up right away   ,  user agent  mozilla       applewebkit         fxios     mobile   safari        steps to reproduce   trying out firefox for ios  in safari  you can close a new tab  opened by another site    using the back button  this is quite handy   actual results   button is greyed out   expected results   not grey out and let the button close the tab  ,0

142,  we don t really have the ability to control remote debugging on a per window basis  so remote debugging is really a runtime setting   ,  this one is kind of hard to describe  so i ll just explain the steps  this is an issue that a few people have been complaining about in the app store reviews     visit   press play to view the video full screen   use the pinch gesture to minimize the video    once the video finishes  it becomes full screen again by itself  and the darn video will keep making itself fullscreen until you tap done or close the tab    on a site like reddit where you are scrolling multiple gifs this is super annoying   ,0

144,  ac issue    mobile android components issues    see comments in ac issue   some quotes     working with  vladikoff and  thomcc  we can now reproduce this consistently  we have some post requests getting sent without a body although the inputstream was correctly passed from a s to a c  then read into a bytebuffer and passed to gwe     gwe also sets the content length header correctly based on the size of the bytebuffer  but then fails to read  and sends an empty request body  after debugging this for a while  one suspicion is the potential offset of the backing array in bytebuffer  in the non working case  we always see an offset  meaning that just consuming e g  from buffer array    wouldn t work as the first byte  will be       since gwe requires a direct bytebuffer    a c doesn t seem to be able to control this offset and it would have to be taken into account on the consuming side     unless gwe is just using jni s getdirectbufferaddress which should just work   ,  this is migrating the existing work in progress for bug     ,0

148,  on versions prior to android n    initializing the wifimanager via context getsystemservice can cause a memory leak if the context is not the application context     in many cases  it s not obvious from the code where the context is coming from    it s possible that the context being passed in is the application context  but to be on the safe side  you should consider changing context getsystemservice  to context getapplicationcontext  getsystemservice    affected class   geckonetworkmanager  ,  update this to use the same component as the data management screen   ,0

152,  from github     gb rust issues       and here we have some description blah blah blah  ,  when attempting to send a tab from another application via the  send tab  share sheet icon  i find the amount of time it takes to load the list of devices takes nearly as long as it would take to type in most urls by hand  causing huge friction    my most recent attempt to send a tab from cold start    it took almost   seconds for my two synced devices to show up   ,0

156,  user agent  mozilla       gecko   firefox      steps to reproduce       updated fox to most recent version  yesterday  on ipad      visited m youtube com  via a bookmark     actual results      youtube returns the desktop version      played with various use cases  requesting desktop site   returning to mobile site via fox reload button choice  and using the new blue dot choice    expected results   should have gone to  and stayed on m youtube  i realize that the presented data  by youtube  is its doing  but in playing with the buttons  above  if feels like there is a fox is this a mobile device toggle which is set incorrectly  and reporting poorly to youtube   i note that before the update  and after  i had strict tracking enabled  and that there were no setting changes after the update   as noted  above  after fiddling with the use cases  i could get things straigt  but that   on clearing data  via settings        the problem returns   there is something about how fox reports the device  to youtube  that changed with the new version  and i am guessing that there is something amiss in how that reporting is operating in the context of the reload button and the blue dot  in the background   will keep playing with use cases  but i have to believe that the ipad environment elsewhere  can duplicate this effect   i will also try going to youtube com  directly  vs  my bookmark   ,  android o has paste as plain text feature  chrome already supports it   ,0

161,  when receiving a tab from an ios device the push notification says  tab received  instead of listing the device name it came from   this is because ios is sending an incorrect id when it sends the tab  so the receiver cannot identify who it is from   ,  noticed this while looking at   mobile android components pull   commits    i m not sure if any app feeds headers straight into  loaduri  but if they do  they can send any arbitrary header  which is probably really bad   we don t validate that the header map is formatted properly here    central source mobile android geckoview src main java org mozilla geckoview geckosession java      so e g  this code       headers put        allows an app   to set a  host  header  even though we try to forbid it here    central rev   mobile android modules geckoview geckoviewnavigation jsm      ,0

172,  created attachment   simulator screen shot   mar          am png  sync sign in has been unresponsive    since yesterday        if you are already logged into sync  first  sign out  from settings     navigate to settings    sign in to firefox    enter your email password and tap  sign in      if using this account for the first time on the device    you ll be sent a confirmation email for validation  so  go ahead and confirm that  you ll notice that the settings screen on your device recognizes that the confirmation has been done  however  it will not log you into the sync account  it ll still display the  sign in to firefox  option in settings     if you have previously used this account on the device    you ll notice that the spinner keeps spinning forever  you ll also notice that a red bar appears at the top of the page with the text  working         the behavior is the same on the ios simulator and on an iphone  however  it works fine for the app store version    it s strange given that both use the same url    service sync context    if you try to manually navigate to that url from your browser s url bar    you ll see the same unresponsive behavior   i didn t classify the bug under  firefox sync  because i m able to sync from version     which is using the same url   ,  our hiding showing of the browser ui when scrolling could be improved  on sites where there is very little scrolling  we hide show the browser ui creating a jittery experience  right now we unhide the browser ui as soon as we get to the bottom of the page   on the ipad hiding the urlbar at all seems a bit overkill  there is already so much real estate  instead just hide the toptabs and always show the urlbar     we can improve the urlbar experience on the iphone in one of   ways     dont unhide the chrome when getting to the bottom of the page  require the user to actively scroll up a bit in order to show the browser ui  the unhiding logic would always show the urlbar on scroll up regardless of the velocity      only unhide the browser ui if the user tries to scrolls down once at the bottom of the page    ,0

176,  lang  mul  is used on wikipedia to show that wikipedia is supported in multiple languages    our translation service should know this and not offer to translate   ,  user agent  mozilla       applewebkit         version       safari        steps to reproduce   here is a set of links that will always set trackers and browsing data  even if the user sets private browsing mode     showing the privacy policy from settings   showing the help page from settings   showing your rights page from settings   showing  show tour  page from settings   open a link in firefox from another application using the sharing extension     opening a link copied from the clipoard     actual results   when i switch to private browsing mode  the app tells me  firefox won t remember your history or cookies    however  this is only partially accurate  and potentially misleading   firefox appears to implement private browsing mode as separate tab groups  one set for private browsing  where no web data is saved  and another tab group for  normal  browsing that does save web data   the issue i see with this implementation is that  even if i select private browsing  firefox will still open some links in the  normal  tab group  with no way to change this behavior to open in the private browsing group    expected results   when i switch to private browsing mode  i expect that no links should open in the  normal browsing  tab group  they should all open in the  private browsing  group   my suggestion would be something to that implements this behavior  for example     all links open in the private tab group when switching to private browsing     a preference  always open links in private mode     help and settings links should either open in the private browsing tab group or the trackers website data is not stored in the app wide website data    create a preference  open links from other applications in private mode    in the absence of these changes  it would be helpful to educate the user that switching to private browsing mode will still store browsing data under some circumstances  as outlined above   ,0
177,    fenix issue    mobile fenix issues     ac issue    mobile android components issues       in the situation described by the fenix issue we have a tab that has a previous state attached but no  geckosession  yet     since it s not being displayed   fenix then decides to load a url in this tab and we create a  geckosession  and call  restorestate   with the previous state  followed by  loaduri   to load the url  right after that fenix switches to the tab and you can see the old state being restored but never the new url load   it seems like the  loaduri   gets lost or races with the previously called  restorestate    ,  when two loads are executed in quick succession  e g  loaduri  then loaduri   we can have two pending onloaduri calls on the gecko stack  both waiting for a response from the ui thread               spineventloopuntil  responds    handleloaduri          spineventloopuntil  responds    handleloaduri         in this case  it s clear that handleloaduri  would not return until after handleloaduri  returns  so  bar  ends up being processed before  foo   the result is an undesirable change in the order of loads  normally  loaduri  would force loaduri  to cancel  but in this case it s the opposite    loaduri  forces loaduri  to cancel   ,1

181,  when delivering a message to geckoview  the scope is the only attribute needed for doing so in the webpushscription  we should change the api to reflect that since passing the full subscription back for every message is harder to reconstruct and unsafe as well   from   onpushevent    onpushevent    to   onpushevent    onpushevent    ,  we talked about it many times  let s add a bug link for every line in the changelog  i ll back fill this for     ,0

220,  this bug continues a conversation from the oct    mobile tech leads  meeting  and more context may be available in the related mailing list thread       dev   october   html  i wanted to move it into a bug to ensure that we don t lose track of it  i ve tried to focus the bug by being as narrow as possible on the  what   but as broad as possible on the  how        for browser like apps that use both geckoview and firefox accounts  we need a way to allow privileged communication between the application and web content running on    here are two examples of how such communication is used in our current browsers  assuming the user is signed in to their browser with fxa     if the user visits   and changes their account password  then the web content sends a message to the browser to tell it that its current session token was invalidated  and gives it a new one so that it can seamlessly continue syncing     if the user visits   and goes to sign in  they will be redirected to    the web content coordinates with the browser to allow the user to sign in to this website without re entering their password  by using their existing login session from the browser itself    on desktop and android  this privileged communication is done via  webchannels   a special bit of plumbing in firefox that ferries events back and forth between chrome and web content       central source toolkit modules webchannel jsm     central source toolkit actors webchannelchild jsm  the web content on   basically does      window addeventlistener    to listen for messages from the browser  and      window dispatchevent     to send messages to the browser   there s corresponding logic inside of firefox to make sure that  webchannelmessagetochrome  events get routed to an appropriate handler function  with appropriate security checks on the page origin etc    on firefox for ios  this privileged communication is done by opening   in a special webview instance and injecting javascript into the page to manage the events       mobile firefox ios blob master client frontend settings fxacontentviewcontroller swift  this has the disadvantage of only working when   is loaded into this special webview   but not when the user just navigates to fxa on the web    what s the right way for us to implement this behaviour in a geckoview app such as fenix  or the reference browser   ,  as part of the webextension support in bug    we need a way to let embedders send and receive messages from content through webextensions   ,1

226,  having the bookmarks and history synced across devices is a great feature  but sometimes it is necessary to search the bookmarks or history items to find some particular result and currently such option is not available  implementing the ability to search the bookmarks and history would be a handy improvement   ,  focus issue    mobile focus android issues    right now to save a tracking exception we are calling  runtime contentblockingcontroller addexception  which calls  addexception method   and   saveexceptionlist     to get the saved exceptions list we are using  accept method   wich returns always an empty list  so we can t restore the previous state  could you please take a look over these gecko methods to confirm us that it behaves as expected   ,0

243,  created attachment   image png  bryan has some new colors for the background of the urlbar   ,  our xcuitests are brittle and repetitive  they are highly dependent on the app  and lots of navigation is required to get to the portion of the app you want to test   furthermore  the navigation is also needed for screenshots  if the app changes  then multiple tests fail  and the fixes need to be made in one place    this bug introduces a screengraph  which helps by sharing the app s screen graph  and then using gameplaykit s path finding to navigate around the app   ,0

logs to files app on next launch  toggle switch in the settings app  this would allow users to flip the switch in the settings app before launching firefox which would cause logs to get saved directly to the files app on ios and hopefully capture information relating to the crash   as a result of this change  we need to remove several unused old settings from the settings bundle before enabling this on production builds  we will then remove     email saved tab state   email logs on launch   disable local web server  ,0
295,  build    device  ipad mini   ios          steps to reproduce     launch the app    open   tab in a normal browsing session    tap on the mask icon a few times to switch between normal browsing and private browsing    check the tab counter while repeating step       actual results     the tab counter animation is incorrectly displayed for a few seconds     see video       v    note    issue reproducible only on ipad  ,  there is a possible crash scenario for users who are upgrading to the swift   build  this doesn t crash the entire app but rather prevents session restore from working    this is related to moving the savedtab class outside of the tabmanager scope and into the file scope  there was a bug in   that prevented session restore from working completely unless the savedtab class was moved outside   ,0
296,  focus team  thank you for your work in bug    we are rolling back to kitsune as of   tomorrow morning and we need you to revert the urls from lithium s structure back to the original   ,  it s an earlgrey issue  and the workaround is to use replacetext  instead   ,0
297,  perhaps this is a setting  perhaps it s an mode     when the user is using an ipad   large screen — especially with a keyboard  there is plenty of real estate on the screen to display a desktop version of the site   sites sniffing ios user agents tend to give more compact versions of the site  and also nag dialogs to install the ios app   submitted on behalf of a contributor   ,  sync is a feature we d like to be more discoverable inside the app  moving the sync settings options into the browser menu would help make the feature easier to find for users who don t go to the settings   ,0

351,  as of now mouse wheel events scroll the contents  but doesn t move the dynamic toolbar  thus there are unreachable contents by wheel events unfortunately   note that on chrome mouse wheel events don t involve dynamic toolbar movement basically it just scrolls the contents  but in the test case of bug   comment      the dynamic toolbar is moving by mouse wheel  then once after the toolbar has been completely hidden  the toolbar will never be re appeared by mouse wheeling  that s a bug on chrome   ,  in bug   we are introducing some cleanup code to delete left over temp files  after a few releases we should remove this code   ,0

360,      this bug was initially created as a clone of bug           from comment           this bug was initially created as a clone of bug             it s like this never ends   and even more   the background colour sampling in browser js s domcontentloaded handler is obsolete  too     ,  in my understandings  nseventstatus econsumenodefault is representing that the event was consumed by either the root apzc or a non root apzc but browsers should do nothing in response to the event   botond suggested in bug   comment   to use  input result unhandled  but i know  ac uses  input result unhandled  to restore the toolbar state    so we should introduce a new flag which we haven t used anywhere   the botond s comment from bug   comment   for references        from comment       the reason that combining  mhandledresult    nothing   with  mstatus    econsumenodefault  doesn t make sense  is that  econsumenodefault  means the event will not be dispatched to gecko  so there will never be a delayed result       so  in a case like this  we should fill in an  mhandledresult  value corresponding to what behaviour we want  i think in this case we may want  unhandled   as we probably don t want to combine overscroll with dynamic toolbar movement   without introducing the new result  bug   will be quite messy because currently we return either  input result handled  or  input resuled handled content  depending on the initial target apzc  but i ve found there is a case where we are not sure about the target apzc   here   and i have no idea how we should treat the case anyway   though  i have no great idea about the name right now  input result should be ignored  if it s long input result consumed or some such   ,0

      gecko   firefox      steps to reproduce   ios     and up support webauthn authentication in safari and embedded safari by default for all nfc supporting iphone    since firefox for ios also uses safari internally  i d expect it to support webauthn as well   go to one of the many demo sites for webauthn       actual results   if you go to a demo site  it shows  webauthn not supported    webauthn detection is based on feature detection on this site  not on user agent sniffing  the required js apis are not available    expected results   firefox should enabled the webauthn fido apis for the embedded safari and support the capabilities of the underlying platform   ,0

422,  lets disable these tests for iphone schema until what is happening with them failing on iphone sim is fixed  please see bug   and comment     bug cgi id      ,  geckoapp fennec calls geckoscreenorientation getinstance  update      which in turn calls geckoappshell resetscreensize      to reset the screen size cached by geckoappshell for responding to calls to getscreensize    a pure geckoview implementation on the other hand   does nothing of the sort  so the cached screen size is never updated after an orientation change   bug   might ultimately result in moving the screen size cache into gecko itself in order to avoid repeated calls along the lines of child process    parent    process    jni    geckoappshell  but even then we d still have to reset that cached value after an orientation change         central annotate   mobile android base java org mozilla gecko geckoapp java         central rev   mobile android geckoview src main java org mozilla gecko geckoscreenorientation java    ,0
423,  fennec hides the address bar when scrolling in the normal page view  but it doesn t hide the reader view toolbar when scrolling   this is a longstanding issue  originally reported on github     mobile firefox ios issues    ,  otherwise you can have stale js when you re changing stuff   ,0

425,  created attachment   firefox ios menu jpg  on iphone    when long clicking on an item from history  bookmarks  or reading list  the menu that pops up is sized such that the contents are slightly cut off and you can scroll a slight amount vertically    this is not reproducible in a simulator from xcode   image attached so you can see the bottom is cut off a little   ,  created attachment   context menu mov  rc           go to the history panel    recently closed     long press on a link to open the context menu    result  the context menu viewport is too small   this is reproducible in all home panels but it s more visible in  recently closed    ,1

429,  migrating as into a uicollectionview has broken the context menu  make sure the context menu works correctly    a few other things have also changed that should be fixed with this pr   there are now uiimageviewextensions to set favicons that provide correct background colors  so no need to pass the uiimage and uicolor from the highlightcell topsitecell to the context menu   ,  steps to reproduce      with firefox focus   geckoview      go to     gr   actual   site keeps reloading  expected  site just loads   this is not happening on    firefox focus webview   firefox for android nightly  ,0
431,  currently geckoview s progressdelegate does not support fine grained progress updates  browsers like firefox focus have to map the onpagestart and onpagestop events to specific progress states i e    and   which leads to suboptimal user experience   if fine grained progress updates are not possible in the short term  it would also makes sense for geckoview to define the progress states   that correspond to onpagesart onpagestop so that implementation don t have to define them   ,  focus uses onprogresschanged in webview to update the progress bar for smoother loading appearance  currently in the geckoview implementation we hard code the progress from         leading to chunky loading appearance and some lag on the progress bar     relevant api is here     onprogresschanged   see gh issue   mobile focus android issues    ,1

437,  when switching to the historypanel   reloaddata   is invoked to run the query to populate the view  then   applytheme   is invoked shortly after and  reloaddata   is called a second time which re runs the same query   ,  this is the firefox for ios version of bug   since it will certainly need its own fix      this bug was initially created as a clone of bug         demo     you show a window modal http auth prompt visually tied to a particular tab before updating the address bar  this can have bad consequences when somebody navigates a trustworthy window to a malicious location  this seems rather undesirable   possible fix  update the address bar and hide the original document before showing the prompt   ,0

455,  currently we are using local notifications for sent tabs  now push notifications are beginning to work  we should probably use the native mechanism to re write the alerts as they are received     this requires a change on autopush     services autopush pull    ,  add a convenience method to match currentcall counter to different values so we don t need to check currentcall counter itself   ,0
456,  user agent  mozilla       gecko   firefox      steps to reproduce   i thought there was a top level button  added recently  but it seems to have disappeared   while it was around  is it still    i noted that it was not clear exactly what data was being cleared    if  for example  it was just another means to duplicate the clear all button inside data management  or if it did something less   but now  i can t even find the new button access anymore    has it been removed   ,  the default implementation of device app hash is a hash based on the idfv plus additional properties of the device  we can change this to a   random identifier that is not connected to ios provided id  this will then reset when the app is reinstalled   ,0
458,  this test is failing lately with error  expect predicate exists    true for  unknown account     nothing has changed that affects the test but this started to failed a few days ago  it is just a timing issue  it will be fixed adding a waitforexistence   ,  in order to provide a  clean    documents directory for storing downloaded files  we need to migrate our stored telemetry pings and the tabsstate archive file to another directory in the app container   ,0
459,  in order to improve our ability to debug startup crash loops  we should add a  save logs to files app on next launch  toggle switch in the settings app  this would allow users to flip the switch in the settings app before launching firefox which would cause logs to get saved directly to the files app on ios and hopefully capture information relating to the crash   as a result of this change  we need to remove several unused old settings from the settings bundle before enabling this on production builds  we will then remove     email saved tab state   email logs on launch   disable local web server  ,  the integration of apilint with  mach lint  adds the  detail  section to the error message  this is unnecessary as the  detail  just contains the name of the method or class that is causing the error  this piece of information is already present in the file line column fields   e g  this        users asferro workspace mozilla central mobile android geckoview src main java org mozilla geckoview runtimetelemetry java         error  field only classes should not be final for mocking   none                                                                                                                                       failures           error  field only classes need at least one constructor for mocking   none                                                                                                                             failures           error  missing field type nullability annotation  needs one of  nullable   nonnull   field public final string name                                                                                    failures           error  missing field type nullability annotation  needs one of  nullable   nonnull   field public final long   values                                                                                  failures          error  method missing threading annotation  needs one of   mainthread   uithread   workerthread   binderthread   anythread   method public void ontelemetryreceived   failures        should be       users asferro workspace mozilla central mobile android geckoview src main java org mozilla geckoview runtimetelemetry java         error  field only classes should not be final for mocking                                                                    failures           error  field only classes need at least one constructor for mocking                                                          failures           error  missing field type nullability annotation  needs one of  nullable   nonnull                                           failures           error  missing field type nullability annotation  needs one of  nullable   nonnull                                           failures          error  method missing threading annotation  needs one of   mainthread   uithread   workerthread   binderthread   anythread   failures        ,0

temporary workaround until we get an api in application services for interrupting sync  we should avoid syncing logins when the app is backgrounded  currently  this is causing the database connection to be held open in the background without the ability to close it until sync has completed  since the network timeout in application services is   seconds and we have about   seconds to clean up  we ll just avoid syncing logins in the background   ,0

466,  allow leanplum to be tested in development mode  it is currently really difficult for qa to properly test leanplum on a production   build because those builds default to use the leanplum production settings  we need a simple way to make leanplum start in development mode   ,  created attachment   qrcode payment account info jpg     scan the attached code expected  alipay should be opened  or a prompt shows up asking user whether open alipay or not   actual  open a webpage in a new tab  saying  a server with the specified hostname could not be found     alipay is something like apple pay  but more complex  and it s very very popular in china   users can use alipay to scan qr code to pay and transfer money  all most every merchant here has a qr code with its own payment account info   the qr code with my account info is attached  you can use it for testing  but pls be careful  do not transfer money to my account  i m not planning to give it back     actions from some competitors in china after scanning the qr code      baidu browser                        open safari    if alipay is already installed  pop up a prompt from safari asking user whether to open alipay      qq browser                       open a webpage of alipay in a new tab    open alipay directly  no prompt      sogou browser                       open a webpage of alipay in the current tab    pop up a prompt asking user whether to open alipay or not  if alipay is already installed      uc browser                       consider it as a text  and just simply shows the following info to user  https   qr alipay com       ,0

468,  a major pain point in the current content blocking exceptions gv api is that fenix would like to support displaying all existing exceptions and allowing the user to remove them individually  since  removeexception  currently takes a  geckosession   this requires a pretty ugly workaround  we should investigate overloading  removeexception  to take a uri instead to facilitate this use case   ,  fenix nightly    gv        using the latest fenix nightly the scroll position doesn t seem to get restored anymore  other state like the back forward history still gets restored  so i am assuming that we still pass the state correctly to geckoview   about     weeks ago i was reading a loooong text in a tab and every time i got back to the app  the scroll position was restored properly  so i guess that this may be a recent regression  also it seems to work as intended in fenix    currently on the release track   ,0

471,  if i try to log in to a page in a geckoview embedded in gmail  bitwarden shows me passwords that match  firefox aurora   or something similar to that  it is unable to detect the page i m on and present the correct passwords   you can still search for the right password  so the functionality isn t completely broken  but it s markedly less convenient   ,  we d like to send push notifications from leanplum  we can do this by creating a second apns certificate and uploading it to leanplum   this ticket includes not only the engineering work    but should include the security and legal review   ,0

527,  user agent  mozilla       gecko   firefox      steps to reproduce   this works flawlessly for regular sessions but it doesn t work for private sessions  strs    open a private session   add a contentblockingcontroller exception for that session    get the stored exceptions via saveexceptionlist or check a session via checkexception   actual results   the exception hasn t been added   expected results   the exception should have been added  ,  we d like to send push notifications from leanplum  we can do this by creating a second apns certificate and uploading it to leanplum   this ticket includes not only the engineering work    but should include the security and legal review   ,0
528,  user agent  mozilla       gecko   firefox      steps to reproduce   in geckoview webextension apis are not working correctly as their implementation comes from fennec and it relies on it s internals    specifically  tab oncreated    tabs onremoved    tabs onupdated    webnavigation oncommited  throw errors when listeners are assigned   ,  currently xcuitests fail in master  because devices bb use run out of space for some reason  they are suggesting this workaround   we re still working on clearing out space  but just want to check  have you considered running your tests on multiple schemes  in parallel   here s one option      duplicate the fennec enterprise xcuitests scheme        enable both fennec enterprise xcuitests and fennec enterprise xcuitests   to be built for scheduled builds        set up fennec enterprise xcuitests to run tests on iphone and set up the fennec enterprise xcuitests   scheme to run tests on ipad    these would run in parallel   ,0

530,  we are not getting any calls to  geckosession navigationdelegate onloaderror   when an  error unknown protocol   occurs   you can reproduce this issue by trying to navigate to  htt   invalid   using the geckoview sample app  this should be shown an error page  but nothing is shown   related  fenix issue   an  android components issue     ,   contentparent  markasdead   is used by gecko s content process management to remove a defunct  contentparent  object from the list of running content processes   note that the actual content process that is associated with this object might still be running  albeit it should be shutting down  the point is that  as far as gecko is concerned  the process is no a longer viable candidate for running content  from geckoview s standpoint  we should also be removing that process from candidate content processes by unbinding its service      ,0
531,  if i run the tests in navigationdelegatetest twice  the safebrowsing ones time out  some investigation has revealed that it only passes if there is no existing profile  if there is any existing profile    even one with no files    the test times out     ,  bug   introduced support for selection actions using floating or fixed toolbar  but there are still some small bugs when using fixed toolbar   ,0
533,  see   bug cgi id      the current implementation of webextensions in geckoview bypasses the addonmanager    central rev   mobile android modules geckoview geckoviewwebextension jsm      since about debugging queries the addonmanager to list webextensions  we currently can t debug webextensions when debugging geckoview browsers   ,  in geckoview we have  registerwebextension  and  unregisterwebextension  to run first party extensions in apps   for third party extensions  we need to support installing and uninstalling an extension so that the following things can happen     we check signatures   we remember settings and options for the extension   the extension runs at startup    we want to reuse code from the  addonmanager  as much as possible here  probably using the  webextensioncontroller  for this   this bug will likely turn into a meta bug   ,1

540,  i noticed that several times i ve been left with partial bookmarks or partial history in my main firefox profile   the only way this can happen is if two things occur      the database is moved recreated     the sync timestamps are not reset   this used to be impossible  in the course of initializing the profile we would create a browsersyncmanager  and it would listen to reset notifications and do the right thing   these days browserprofile init is eager  it eagerly creates browserdb    which tries to create the schema table  which can trigger the database replacement logic   browsersyncmanager observes ondatabasewasrecreated  but browsersyncmanager takes a profile as an init argument   if the database is moved out of the way during the init of browserprofile  there will be no browsersyncmanager listening for the database recreation logic  and we will be left with partial sync data   the fix is to somehow ensure that the correct sync related code runs if the db needs to be recovered  perhaps via a flag in profile  or by rearranging the init of browsersyncmanager   it s also necessary to detect this state and recover — perhaps by checking for a  bak file  once  and re syncing the appropriate database   ,  we don t want to show docs for every  public  type in the aar right now  as many things are marked incorrectly  obviously that s something we can fix  but short term we can just include the types we actually view as part of geckoview   ,0

604,  from   mobile fenix issues     i guess that this is  nsidomwindowutils  zoomtofocusedinput     issue or editor doesn t call  setinputcontext    at least  when we show software keyboard  content should scroll to visible position of caret       steps to reproduce    add contenteditable true attribute on a div using dev tools    write something long so that element height should be more than device height     change cursor position using click in bottom of the content   you can use following gist to add html and content using dev tools             expected behavior element should not scroll on top       actual behavior element scrolls on top when cursor position changes by click  ,  to help support   content server issues   we need the ability for fxios to expose the fxa login state to the fxa web content  this will allow us to give the correct messaging to users when they verify from within fxios   an initial implementation could include rendering a hidden div with the following properties        div id  fxa state  data state  verified  data devices        div id  fxa state  data state  unverified  data devices        div id  fxa state  data state  not logged in  data devices            ,0
605,  the tests don t compile because     integer literal     overflows when stored into  int  xctasserttrue    ,  background  when fetching remote history we only fetch   visits for each url  when calculating frecency local visits are given a huge advantage  visting a site locally     times can put it in front of a site with   visits    imagine the following scinario     a user downloads firefox and sets up sync  their topsites look pretty good  they ve already browsed their favourite news sites for the day so they don t do any browsing     their mom calls  and asks for help with their att bill  they open firefox and go to the att home page  click through to the contact page and get the phone number       the next day the user open firefox to browse some news and your first topsite is att    visting a site  and browsing   urls on that page is enough to bump it into topsites  should that really be the case    we still need to take local visit into account  but maybe not as heavy as we do now    i can see   ways to fix this       reduce the local weight such that a local site needs at minimum half of the visits compared to a remote site to become a topsite      incorporate the visit transition type into the frecency calculation  if you typed att com once and then clicked through to   different urls  those   urls should not be used to bump up the frecency of att com as much   ,0
606,  with the fenix ac migration to the new media session api    we can deprecate the now unused media element api   ,  the three tests of tracking protection test suite are failing   it looks like the check when blocking an element is not done correctly  although the correct element for the check is shown the test fails to check that it appears   logs with the failure     build   test                      investigating how to fix this  ,0
607,  i don t think we are actually using this dependency  and it is still complaining about converting to a new swift version every time we open the project   ,  currently our documentation site is on github where all our user documentation is kept  this means that our documentation is not kept in the same place as our codebase  there are many disadvantages to this  such as it prevents us from doing things like importing example code from building source  which may result in our documentation not being up to date with changes and also means that we cannot tie documentation examples to the changelog or api txt   this bug is the first stage in addressing these issues   moving all of the markdown and examples that form the basis of our documentation site into mozilla central  and updating the github site documentation in the same way that we currently do with our javadoc     part of this issue may be looking at how we can lock down the github site to prevent commits from happening directly there  forcing all changes to come from edits in mc   things to consider      how do we test jekyll changes from mc  do we have to keep the entire jekyll site here in order to achieve that     do we need to add installation of jekyll and associated tools alongside mach bootstrap to ensure that anyone is automatically set up to view locally  or just include instructions for those that need them     do we handle user docuementation in a separate task to javadoc  or should they be lumped together under gv docs   ,0
608,  an app can map swipe gestures to back forward navigation   or pull to refresh   commands  but it needs to know whether web content wants to handle those input events itself     james suggests a simple api so the app can ask if the web content has any input event handlers that might want to capture gestures   ,    filed by    ncsoregi  at  mozilla com   parsed log       job id   repo autoland

646,  currently our documentation site is on github where all our user documentation is kept  this means that our documentation is not kept in the same place as our codebase  there are many disadvantages to this  such as it prevents us from doing things like importing example code from building source  which may result in our documentation not being up to date with changes and also means that we cannot tie documentation examples to the changelog or api txt   this bug is the first stage in addressing these issues   moving all of the markdown and examples that form the basis of our documentation site into mozilla central  and updating the github site documentation in the same way that we currently do with our javadoc     part of this issue may be looking at how we can lock down the github site to prevent commits from happening directly there  forcing all changes to come from edits in mc   things to consider      how do we test jekyll changes from mc  do we have to keep the entire jekyll site here in order to achieve that     do we need to add installation of jekyll and associated tools alongside mach bootstrap to ensure that anyone is automatically set up to view locally  or just include instructions for those that need them     do we handle user docuementation in a separate task to javadoc  or should they be lumped together under gv docs   ,  user agent  mozilla       gecko   firefox     build id     steps to reproduce   i want to set network trr mode to   and network trr uri to   dns com dns query   actual results   about config is not working in firefox ios   expected results   give me the setting to activate trusted recursive resolver for doh  ,0

685,  as part of research for   bug cgi id    specifically  attempting to close all tabs to see the wkwebview state resets  i see that the wkwebviews in memory is tab count       while this isn t a leak  it should be fixed  wkwebviews reaching zero may fix certain types of errors if the webview process is able to reset     the problem is likely how tab webview is retained outside of the tab class  or the tab itself retained longer than needed   during investigation  it became clear that tab webview is far too exposed throughout the app  making it impossible to guard access to this object  it is also hard to gauge who what how this object is being used outside of the tab     careful code review will ensure it is accessed weakly   in all instances  but a much better design would be to wrap this in an accessor  moreover  this would be a great first step for webview app architecture improvements  once we have controlled the access to the webview  the next step is to improve the interfaces to match the app requirements  for instance  instead of kvo in various places  the kvo would be made internal to tabwebview and listeners would add themselves as delegates   ,  steps to reproduce enable talkback load a webpage swipe to select an element on the page pinch to zoom the page in  expected behavior the talkback focus rectangle should stay on the originally selected element  actual behavior the talkback focus rectangle moves to some random place on the page  device information      android device  samsung galaxy    android version         fenix version          see also   mobile fenix issues    ,0

689,  not sure whether this is a bug or not or if it is already covered in another bug  but looks like at the first sync the bookmarks are not shown   steps    go to menu    settings    sign in to firefox    login with a valid account and confirm on the email received   go to history    synced devices   go to bookmarks tab  actual    on settings it is possible to see the account and sync now which shows the last time the synchronization was done   the synced device and the tabs open there are correctly shown   this is empty  with the default message  bookmarks you save will show up here  shown   note  if after checking that the bookmarks have not been synced  i go to settings    sync now options and then back to bookmarks tab  then  the bookmarks appear correctly  expected  as it happens with the synced devices and open tabs  i would expect to have the bookmarks available at the first synchronization without the need to force it from settings so that they are shown or having to wait till there is a synchronization    ,  to resolve the timed auto navigation that was occurring on ios after the verification logic went live in december on the fxa server    we recently deployed some logic to remove this delay and have the fxa server send us back the token right way      we also added some code to auto dismiss if we were already verified   the existing ios client logic is to take the token that is sent from the server  create a local firefoxaccount object  and begin syncing if it is able to      since the server is now sending the token back immediately instead of after the account has been verified  the sync doesn t auto start because account still needs to be verified  once that account is verified there is  no way for the server to tell the client   i believe the assumption was that when a user forces a sync  this will sort itself out but is sub optimal for first logins as the sync won t happen until next launch   this in turn is causing the two reported bugs     bug cgi id     bug cgi id          bug cgi id         mobile firefox ios blob master client frontend settings settingstableviewcontroller swift       mobile firefox ios blob master providers profile swift    ,1

698,  focus currently uses the download support from webview  and they would like to have it for geckoview too  the relevant webview api is here     ,  google com search results usually ranks pretty high in the frecency calculations  and because most of the time you don t actually go to the google homepage some random google search result ends up being your first topsite    it makes sense to just remove google search from top sites  other google properties like docs and mail should still become topsites   ,0

702,  prior to send tab via push landing  sending tabs was done during periodic sync     each sync of the clients collection  consumes  all the pending sent tabs  when a periodic sync consumes a tab that was going to be displayed by a push notification    the push notification displays a best effort  but non useful message   early consumption is also seen when apns is slow  and fxa is fast and the user sends multiple tabs  this is early consumption of tabs by prior push notifications   this bug   needs      move all clients collection syncing into notificationservice and manual   sync      a strategy for notificationservice to handle sent tab notifications that don t contain tabs  e g  playing a silent sound  or getdeliverednotificationswithcompletionhandler    removedeliverednotificationswithidentifiers   ,  master   iphone          go to today and tap on any button in the fennec widget    result  firefox is foregrounded but no new tabs are open  ,0
703,  on firefox desktop if i type  moz  into the urlbar  it will likely autofill the rest of the url  mozilla org  and if i press enter i go to that url   in ios  if i type  moz   the rest of the url fills out  but when i press enter  it just does a search on  moz   i have to touch the url bar again to accept the autocompleted url   so  if a url auto completes as i type  and i press enter  it should go to the url   ,  bug report from mfinkle      switch to the gboard keyboard  type  wiki   which will autocomplete to  wikipedia org   hit go  this will do a google search instead of going to the autocompleted domain   ,1
704,  sentry currently reports the ios version only  as in         i think it would be useful for us to also filter on the internal build version  then we can see differences between for example ios   beta releases   ,  after the swift   migration  we re no longer able to compile our distribution targets   using either whole module optimization or single file optimizations  setting it single file shows that the swift compiler crashes when trying to process sync s threewaymerger swift   marking as blocking   since we can t really submit the app with optimizitions off   ,0

745,   runjunit py  supports multiple test filters  in theory    however when the tests actually run  only the final test specified in the list of filters is executed   according to the   am instrument  documentation      e class  may be used to run a single test   otoh  it looks to me like the way to get multiple filters to work is to push a text file to the device that containing the list of tests to run  and then specifying that file using   e testfile    ,  it usually happens on bb when running one of the tests belonging to databasefixture test   testbookmarksdatabasefixture  testhistorydatabasefixture  the tests fail due to asynchronous wait failed  exceeded timeout of   seconds  with unfulfilled expectations  ,0

755,      this bug was initially created as a clone of bug           description    in the new tab page of firefox on ios  there is no  dismiss  option to hide a recommended story and see a new one  this feature is present in firefox on desktop   this causes a confusing experience for users who wish to dismiss an item for various reasons and find that it s not possible      technical information      firefox for ios   firefox             steps to reproduce       open firefox    open new tab page    scroll down to recommended by pocket article    long press article       look for  dismiss  option    actual results    no dismiss option to hide an article and see it replaced with a new one    expected results    dismiss option should be present in feature parity with desktop experience  ,  from the surveygizmo feedback   when opening a link in a new   tab  the address bar and navigation buttons   show up again  after having disappeared due to scrolling down  i find this behavior a little annoying  as it slightly shifts my position on the page    seems like a reasonable request  i think with the new toast to switch to the tab right away i dont think we need to show the ui chrome   ,0

859,  if a user is making a new tab via a keyboard shortcut also focus the urlbar so they can start typing   this might not work as well when a user is spamming cmd t it could cause the keyboard to show hide very quickly  maybe focusing the toolbar after a small delay to make sure the user is done opening new tabs would work well   ,  i needed to detect when the browser goes to background in a gecko cpp class  but i found the  application background  event isn t triggered in geckoview  the event is triggered from nsappshell  onpause     we can call geckothread onpause  and geckothread onresume  to trigger the pause resume logic from  nsappshell    ,0
860,  in my understandings  nseventstatus econsumenodefault is representing that the event was consumed by either the root apzc or a non root apzc but browsers should do nothing in response to the event   botond suggested in bug   comment   to use  input result unhandled  but i know  ac uses  input result unhandled  to restore the toolbar state    so we should introduce a new flag which we haven t used anywhere   the botond s comment from bug   comment   for references        from comment       the reason that combining  mhandledresult    nothing   with  mstatus    econsumenodefault  doesn t make sense  is that  econsumenodefault  means the event will not be dispatched to gecko  so there will never be a delayed result       so  in a case like this  we should fill in an  mhandledresult  value corresponding to what behaviour we want  i think in this case we may want  unhandled   as we probably don t want to combine overscroll with dynamic toolbar movement   without introducing the new result  bug   will be quite messy because currently we return either  input result handled  or  input resuled handled content  depending on the initial target apzc  but i ve found there is a case where we are not sure about the target apzc   here   and i have no idea how we should treat the case anyway   though  i have no great idea about the name right now  input result should be ignored  if it s long input result consumed or some such   ,  build      device  ipad air   ios       steps to reproduce     go to sportsdirect com    tap on  mens  drop down  actual result    the context menu is opened when single tapping on  mens  menu  also noticed this behaviour on www bestbuy com while tapping on  products    note     this is not reproducible in safari    see video       v    ,0

898,  user agent  mozilla       gecko   firefox      steps to reproduce   on an iphone  i went to the menu and selected logins   passwords  i typed in the passcode and then clicked the home button once  when i went back into firefox  when i was prompted for the passcode  i hit cancel    actual results   i go to the logins   passwords screen and can access all logins and passwords as if i had typed in the passcode    expected results   i should have been unable to access the logins  i m not sure how  possibly by blurring all the logins  like what happens if i press the home button twice instead of once in the steps to reproduce   ,  testing firefox beta   on my ipad pro   and i don t have a top tab bar when opening tabs   ,0

900,  we should support  tabs onactivated  maybe asking embedders to tell us which one is the current active tab with a new api like  webextensioncontroller setactivetab   or something like that   this is used by some extensions to update the browser action popup   the code today waits for a fennec event which is never fired    central rev   mobile android components extensions ext tabs js      mdn    us docs mozilla add ons webextensions api tabs onactivated  ,  while looking at other bugs i noticed that we have a  lot  of fennec code in geckoappshell and dependent files  so i went ahead and cleaned that up   ,0

923,  i know we chose this string in bug    but in talking to elvin  it seems there are concerns that this string is misleading to users because we persist a   uuid across reports  so it s not technically anonymous  elvin requested that we change this string     for example  firefox android uses a much longer string     but it doesn t claim anonymity  we should change this to a similar string  but   shorter       shares performance  usage  hardware and customization data about your browser with mozilla to help us make firefox better   ,  there are several implementations of syncdelegate  this should all behave in the same way    when a tab is received by the app       if the app is backgrounded  a notification should show up      if the app is foregrounded  the tab should open up   ,0
924,  a big pain point for developers is with multiple artifacts per architecture  especially as gv apps add multiple dependencies with native code     publishing a fat aar alongside the architecture dependent ones would help with this   bug   is the first part of this sequence  getting the initial bgv   job running in automation   this tracks getting a ngv   job running and getting the corresponding gv beetmover task working  so that we publish the fat aar to maven mozilla org   ,  created attachment   screen shot       at       pm png  as per bryan bell s mockup  we can add a title to this menu to help disambiguate and clarify it vs the app menu   ,0

934,  i think this is probably the expected thing for app developers  if there are cases where we can t shouldn t do this  it should be made clear in the docs   ,  when i call  window open  from a mochitest  the opened page appears to be visible in the foreground  yet its  browser docshellisactive  is false  consequently  extensions are unable to identify the active tab in mochitests in geckoview   via   tab getactive      this unexpected behavior is not limited to testrunneractivity    when i call  window open  from a webpage in  geckoview example   then the urlbar is updated  but the content is not  and  browser docshellisactive  is also  false    currently  geckoview s setsession   seems responsible for  marking a session as active    via the    geckoview setactive   message    which ends up  setting  docshellisactive      my interest in this originates from the the attempt to support the  active  property in the tabs api  but as the last link above shows  there is more to the   geckoview setactive   message than just setting the  docshellisactive  flag   if we are mainly interested in  docshellisactive   then setting it when necessary would work     if the only concern is the  active  flag of the tabs api  then there are also other hacks  such as noticing that a tab is currently only active iff its window equals  services wm getmostrecentbrowserwindow       ,0

939,  currently  a webextension that registers itself early with geckoview only loads its background page much later when the geckoview with web content is already visible onscreen   this presents a serious problem for webextensions like secure proxy which require a background process already loaded to ensure we don t request the first page insecurely before the proxy is authenticated and ready   do we have any mechanism to allow webextension background pages to load eagerly in geckoview  if not  could we add this functionality  this is definitely a requirement for the release of secure proxy and it may affect other extensions we intend to support   ,  when  org mozilla gecko geckothread runuithreadcallback  shows up on the main thread in a profile  doesn t call into other functions so it s difficult to answer essential perf questions like   what is it executing     does that need to happen now    and  what caused this method to be running now   it also makes it difficult for the perf team to identify the root cause of perf issues with this code  causing imprecise perf bug reports that require further investigation  for example  see bug   and this recent profile we took of opening the tabs tray      i d suggest adding profiler markers that explain what runuithreadcallback is executing   if there is another way to answer  what is runuithreadcallback  executing from a profile  perhaps this isn t necessary –   let me know how we can do that      ,0

946,  i think we do have some  threadutils assertonuithread  sprinkled around  but we also need to make sure something makes it into the javadoc too  android has  uithread and similar  but i think all that does is add   static checking     i think we could annotate things with  uithread or  anythread  but back that up with assertions  then add some stuff to our javadoc   that makes sure that gets exposed in the documentation           thread annotations html  ,  sentry currently reports the ios version only  as in         i think it would be useful for us to also filter on the internal build version  then we can see differences between for example ios   beta releases   ,0
948,  this depends on proper punycode support  which we do not have in   x  ,  originally there was a bug with ui code being modified from a background thread in notificationrootviewcontroller swift didfinishsyncing  i decided to wrap things in dispatchasync main but that seems like it introduced a crash  i ll need to investigate this a bit more   first step is undoing the change i introduced that is causing the crash  then to figure out what the problem actually is  it is probably related to the multiple dispatch asyncs and the defer call   ,0

950,  geckosession should provide an api for getting an inputconnection instance and for handling key events  that will involve changing geckoeditable because it relies on geckoview right now  furthermore  it would be even better if we can get rid of the wrapforjni annotations from geckoeditable itself  to prepare for the eventual process split  finally  geckoview will use the new api to handle methods like oncreateinputconnection   ,  created attachment   page action menu   png  for most user setting a home button is a pointless enterprise  and if they do use it  they would only need to do this once  ever  having this present in the page action menu gives this feature more gravitas then it deserves  or we would like    a home button is increasingly pointless  especially now that we have a user editable topsites  where users can set    homepages     setting a home page and injecting a dedicated icon into an already crowded toolbar should be a deliberate act  and not prone to a  fat fingering  event   ,0

963,  there is a possible crash scenario for users who are upgrading to the swift   build  this doesn t crash the entire app but rather prevents session restore from working    this is related to moving the savedtab class outside of the tabmanager scope and into the file scope  there was a bug in   that prevented session restore from working completely unless the savedtab class was moved outside   ,  wkurlschemehandler can replace gcdwebserver and avoids the security risks of having a separate web server running in the app   however  reader mode is heavily based on gcdwebserver and will need to be ported as a separate bug  as this work is a large task   ,0

   ,  background  when fetching remote history we only fetch   visits for each url  when calculating frecency local visits are given a huge advantage  visting a site locally     times can put it in front of a site with   visits    imagine the following scinario     a user downloads firefox and sets up sync  their topsites look pretty good  they ve already browsed their favourite news sites for the day so they don t do any browsing     their mom calls  and asks for help with their att bill  they open firefox and go to the att home page  click through to the contact page and get the phone number       the next day the user open firefox to browse some news and your first topsite is att    visting a site  and browsing   urls on that page is enough to bump it into topsites  should that really be the case    we still need to take local visit into account  but maybe not as heavy as we do now    i can see   ways to fix this       reduce the local weight such that a local site needs at minimum half of the visits compared to a remote site to become a topsite      incorporate the visit transition type into the frecency calculation  if you typed att com once and then clicked through to   different urls  those   urls should not be used to bump up the frecency of att com as much   ,0

background page much later when the geckoview with web content is already visible onscreen   this presents a serious problem for webextensions like secure proxy which require a background process already loaded to ensure we don t request the first page insecurely before the proxy is authenticated and ready   do we have any mechanism to allow webextension background pages to load eagerly in

1019,  i understand that every time a download starts  engineobserver onexternalresource    from ac  is supposed to be called by  geckoenginesession onexternalresponse    however this only happens when a download is started and the user is prompted for confirmation   steps to reproduce      open fenix and go to thinkbroadband com download    select a file to donwnload    user is prompted to confirm download and engineobserver onexternalresource   is called    long press any image   and select save to download said small image  expected result     engineobserver onexternalresource  is called for both downloads  actual result     engineobserver onexternalresource  is called only for downloads that require confirmation from the user  ,  this is migrating the existing work in progress for bug     ,0

1023,  we need to create a test that loads browser db with         site   favicon url in history   we can visit first link of each page if we want to increase the site count to    and measure the time for sql transaction     in order to do this  we need to      create a browser db with populated data  and put it in test fixtures folder       add nimbledroid bookend surrounding above method    load the browser db when a specific xcuitest starts    the test will invoke the method in     ,  dark mode settings will provide ability to choose to enable disable the mode  and to use the screen brightness to toggle dark mode   ,0
1024,  it seems that storage framework is linking to the the copy of sqlite bundled with mozillaappservices framework automatically  this version is not compiled with   dsqlite threadsafe    which is leading to major performance problems  until the sqlite bundled with mozillaappservices framework can be updated to be multi threaded  we can use the ios system provided sqlite   ,  it usually happens on bb when running one of the tests belonging to databasefixture test   testbookmarksdatabasefixture  testhistorydatabasefixture  the tests fail due to asynchronous wait failed  exceeded timeout of   seconds  with unfulfilled expectations  ,0

1028,  with   disabled  the nsiuriloaddelegate may not be registered in time in the geckoviewnavigationcontent js frame script before a loaduri request is processed  this results in a missing onloadrequest call and potentially an unexpected call to onnewsession   ,  unless there are good reasons otherwise  i think we should use the session rule so that we are tracking those sessions and promptly destroying them when the tests are over   ,0
1029,  not sure if this is a regression or a change in the implementation but now the new sites visited do not appear on top sites and so the xcuitests covering different scenarios there fail   this is happening on   x branch  see for example this test  activitystreamtest testtopsitesadd   it checks that there are   top sites as default   goes to   taps to go back  once in home panel screen it checks that there are   tops sites now  please see bb logs here     build   test                      this is the latest commit where tests work   mobile firefox ios commit    investigating if this can be a regression introduced by one of the three commits landed after that one   also some unit tests are failing since one of those commits   landed  will investigate and open a separate bug for that if needed   ,  it s nice that we have an android studio project that allow us to build geckoview example and geckoview  but it would be nice if hitting the  run  button would also bring in any changes to gecko itself  the workflow is basically      add a new method to geckoview    implement above method in gecko using js or native code    write a test or new api in geckoviewexample or other sibling project    win  since setting up a gecko build is such an involved process i think we could just punt on that  we d probably just assume that  mach build    mach package  works  i don t think we really want studio to install a mozconfig  for instance  the instructions for getting this to work for developers would basically be  mach bootstrap   set up mozconfig  then ensure  mach configure  works  ,0

1035,  in bug   and  fenix      there were reports of jumping around whilst scrolling on various different websites  in bug   i fixed an apz related issue present on bugzilla  but the bug is still present on twitter and appears to have a different cause   from the original report    steps to reproduce      open      scroll down slowly       mobile fenix issues       actual results      from time to time it jumps up          expected results      continuous scroll down  ,  fenix would like to add in app autofill using the same methods we have for implementing android autofill  they would additionally like that to work on devices with api       the  viewstructure  class is only in     so we need to have our own version of that for  sessiontextinput  and  textinputdelegate  interfaces  the  geckoview  class would of course still need to use  viewstructure  for android autofill  so this new thing needs to easily convert to a  viewstructure  for that case   ,0
