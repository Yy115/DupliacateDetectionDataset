attachment   rcp address book demonstrating the problem  hi   first  sorry if my bug is not assigned to the correct team  please forward to the correct team   context    i develop an rcp application using eclipse legacy api     the product is built using tycho  for the major envs      linux and macos   description of the problem   on macosx high sierra  using the latest    the rcp app does not accept any mouse events     workaround   if i use the    it works as expected  note that the   is used to launch the eclipse instance and works without issue  only the rcp runtime does not work as expected   logs does not indicates any differences between the two launches    steps to reproduce    import the simple rcp adress book example attached  install use   as runtime jre     here is my dev

when randomly stopping to see the size  i ve observed sizes of    before they are levelled again  e g  by a typesystem reset  call or by a new typesystem creation    tostring  ing the hashmap entries in the debugger at random points shows that the  same  type is often repeated  for example                                                                                                    unresolved

internalparameterizedtypebinding equals  method  i can say that in the above example     type are the same instance   enclosingtype are null   arguments are different arrays with the  same  content    but different instances  so the equals  check fails  instances are always wildcardbinding with different bound instance and id values  the difference being that in wildcardbinding bound

the  same  types all over   i ll be happy to provide more profiling   debugging information  or you can try it yourself with   but i d like to stress once more that this kind of problem seems to happen to anyone who uses a bit more than the average enterprise software level of generics in java  this is a very significant problem for us generic loving folks  and i haven t even started using

just downloaded and installed the latest release candidate of eclipse        when i tried to launch it after the installation it crashes with the attached report  the reason is that eclipse by itself tries to run with java    which i have installed on my system but which is not the default  when i type  java  version  in a shell i get java   and not    the fact that eclipse uses java   instead results in several noclassdeffounderrors due to classes which were removed in java    to my opinion eclipse should by default use the default java of a system and should not try to find the highest

updated     to      after doing so  now when i m attached to certain debug configurations i get an internal error panel   on what i ve measured at about five minute intervals  a screenshot of the panel is attached  the particular debug configuration happens to be a remote configuration to a vm that includes threads that come and go relatively frequently  which results in the thread tree view in the debug tab being updated  i only bring this up because the backtrace from the error view says that this is a swt error related to removing items from a tree  however  the thread activity far outpaces the periodic appearance of these panels  so this may be a coincidence   at this point i ve upgraded two machines  and both of them exhibit this behavior when run against the same debug configuration   it s possible that this was happening in      but i don t think so because this panel is pretty annoying and i would have noticed   unfortunately it s difficult to come up with steps to reproduce this  the problem happens if i m just sitting here staring at the ide and otherwise doing nothing  the local development situation is large and complex  so there s nothing i can hand over  the first thing i d try to reproduce this on a smaller scale would be to cook up a test app that causes a bunch of thread activity  set up a remote debug configuration for it  then run  attach  and

i restarted  it brings up the splash screen   it immediately presents a dialog saying  an error has occurred  see the log file        the error occurs every time i try to start it   i ve even gone through the sequence of reinstalling eclipse and going through the same steps  and the result is the same   this may be caused by some sort of communications error  but i m just guessing  there s something odd going on with the proxy servers used at our company  we recently decommissioned the old proxy  which i ll call  old proxy  here  we re now all using the  new proxy   and all my settings in the vm use the  new proxy   i updated apt with that proxy and installed some external tools   when i ran the eclipse installer  it first failed  prompting me to set the proxy  so i set it to the  new proxy   and it still failed   just in case  i tried setting it to the  old proxy    that worked   it finished installing and i launched it  i opened the marketplace client  i installed some plugins  when i restarted  it got the described error   consistently   there s obviously something odd going on with the proxy   it may be directly related to the error i m getting here  but i don t
