why is this a problem exactly  many reasons     if you accidentally hit the up arrow key without realizing it then you re now in a situation where the left and right keys you re used to using do what they re supposed to any more  and the only way to get things to work again is by noticing that focus has changed  and hitting the up   down arrows an appropriate amount of times to refocus on the text

now be in the address bar  clicking left   right at this point will move the cursor in the address bar  just like it always has  but if you click down a few more times until focus is on the search engine suggestions  then left   right no longer move the cursor    expected results   the best option i can think of for making the new gui work is as follows  left   right keys always move the cursor in the actual text which is visible in the address search bar  this happens regardless of whether you have a suggestion focused  or a search engine focused  up and down arrows still move you to the next or previous suggestion in the suggestions dropdown  and through the search engine suggestions once you reach the bottom  if someone wants to search with twitter instead of with google  they d just enter their search term and then hit the up arrow   times to select  twitter  from the search engine list  then click enter  this is no slower than how you d do it with the current behaviour    this is better for a bunch of reasons  it keeps the meaning of the left and right arrow keys while focused on the address bar consistent   they always move your cursor in the address bar  it means that if you enter something you want to search for  you can edit it at any time  let s say you typed  african swallow  in the address bar  hit the  up  key a few times to select  search from wikipedia   and then realized that you actually wanted to search for  european swallow  instead  the way things are set up right now you d have to press the down arrow multiple times to get back into text entry

entered   instead it will change which search engine is selected  if you keep hitting right or left then it will keep on just changing which search engine is selected    the up and down arrows also change search engine     but they do not wrap pressing control l will select all the text in the address bar again  but entering left and right arrow keys afterwards will still continue changing which search engine is selected  clicking in the text in the address bar will change where text input happens but also does not make left and right arrow keys work in the address bar again  the only way to get the left and right arrow keys to work properly again is by hitting down or up arrows repeatedly until keyboard focus moves back to the address bar  note that only the  up  and  down  keys work   because left and right wrap in the bottom you can hit them all you want and they ll never get you out of the search engine selection area   why is this a problem exactly  many reasons     if you accidentally hit the up arrow key without realizing it then you re now in a situation where the left and right keys you re used to using do what they re supposed to any more  and the only way to get things to work again is by noticing that focus has changed  and hitting the up   down arrows an appropriate amount of times to refocus on the text input area so you can finally move your cursor to the right place in a url and edit it  fat fingering the  up  key shouldn t break your flow while using a browser      it s not consistent with how left   right keys work in the rest of the suggestions dropdown  if i enter  test   then a bunch of suggestions pop up below  hit the  down  arrow to select one of them  and that suggestion s url will now be in the address bar  clicking left   right at this point will move the cursor in the address bar  just like it always has  but if you click down a few more times until focus is on the search engine suggestions  then left   right no longer move the cursor    expected results   the best option i can think of for making the new gui work is as follows  left   right keys always move the cursor in the actual text which is visible in the address search bar  this happens regardless of whether you have a suggestion focused  or a search engine focused  up and down arrows still move you to the next or previous suggestion in the suggestions dropdown  and through the search engine suggestions once you reach the bottom  if someone wants to search with twitter instead of with google  they d just enter their search term and then hit the up arrow   times to select  twitter  from the search engine list  then click enter  this is no slower than how you d do it with the current behaviour    this is better for a bunch of reasons  it keeps the meaning of the left and right arrow keys while focused on the address bar consistent   they always move your cursor in the address bar  it means that if you enter something you want to search for  you can edit it at any time  let s say you typed  african swallow  in the address bar  hit the  up  key a few times to select  search from wikipedia   and then realized that you actually wanted to search for  european swallow  instead  the way things are set up right now you d have to press the down arrow multiple times to get back into text entry mode  change african to european in the address bar  and then click  up  a few times to select the wikipedia search engine again  if you adopt my suggestion then someone can edit their search term without needing to unselect and then re select the search engine they want to use first '],1
